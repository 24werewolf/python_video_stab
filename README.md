# Python Video Stabilization
 Python video stabilization script using OpenCV. 
 
 This is a translation of [the C++ script](http://nghiaho.com/uploads/code/videostab.cpp
) provided in [SIMPLE VIDEO STABILIZATION USING OPENCV](http://nghiaho.com/?p=2093) by NGHIAHO12.
 
 I did not write this code.  The code was found in the comments section of the linked blog entry.  The commenter who posted the code was koala.  I have made some modifications to koala's original code (i.e. formating, adding some arguments/features, commenting).
 
### Example output
too shaky for good example, but you get the idea
